# /scrape-ads

## What It Does

This skill scrapes every active competitor ad from Meta Ad Library using Apify. It reads your competitors from Airtable, scrapes their ads, downloads video creatives, transcribes them with Whisper, classifies each ad by angle and format, and pushes everything to an Ad Research table in Airtable.

You end up with a complete database of competitor ads - copy, media, hooks, transcripts, video previews, and classifications - all searchable and sortable in Airtable.

---

## When to Use It

- After `/competitor-research` has built your competitor database
- Weekly or bi-weekly to catch new competitor ads
- Before running `/ad-brief` to generate an intelligence report
- When a competitor launches a new campaign and you want to study it

---

## How to Run It

```
/scrape-ads
```

Claude handles everything automatically:

1. Loads credentials (Airtable, Apify)
2. Reads active competitors from your Airtable Competitors table
3. Scrapes each competitor's ads via Apify Facebook Ads Library Scraper
4. Deduplicates against existing Ad Research records
5. Transforms and inserts new ads into Airtable
6. Downloads video ads and transcribes with Whisper
7. Classifies each ad by angle and format
8. Prints summary with counts per competitor

## Part of the Ad System

```
/competitor-research → /scrape-ads → /ad-brief → /script-ads → /launch-ads
```

- **`/competitor-research`** - builds competitor database
- **`/scrape-ads`** - scrapes all their active ads
- **`/ad-brief`** - generates intelligence report from scraped ads

---

## Troubleshooting

**"No competitors found in Airtable"**
Run `/competitor-research` first to populate the Competitors table.

**"Apify scraper returned 0 ads"**
The competitor might not have active ads, or the Ad Library ID might be wrong. Check the Ad Library URL manually.

**"Video download failed"**
Some Meta ad videos are protected. The skill logs failures and continues with the rest.

**"Whisper transcription errors"**
Usually caused by very short ads (< 5 seconds) or ads with no speech. These get skipped automatically.

---

## Changelog

- **v1.0** - Full Apify scraping pipeline, deduplication, video download + Whisper transcription, angle/format classification, Airtable integration.
